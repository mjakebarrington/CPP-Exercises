# Principles and Practice Using C++
A repository of completed exercises from the book "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" (2nd Edition) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-2nd/dp/0321992784 "Amazon Link")) by Bjarne Stroustrup.

### Please note:

I have compiled all exercises using GCC (https://gcc.gnu.org/). I have not tested them with any other compiler. Though they should compile fine. I also use standard headers instead of the one Bjarne provides in his book for the first 10 chapters.

Some exercises may not be from the book, but are relevant exercises for the chapter. I have added them for extra practice.

Some exercises may not be the most efficient. This is intentional for many exercises. The goal is usually to demonstrate a concept, not to write an award-winning algorithm.
