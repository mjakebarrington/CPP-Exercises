# C++ Exercises
This is a repository of completed C++ exercises for beginners. Many are from the book "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" (2nd Edition) ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-2nd/dp/0321992784 "Amazon Link")) by Bjarne Stroustrup.

### Please note:

I have compiled all exercises using GCC (https://gcc.gnu.org/). I have not tested them with any other compiler. Though they should compile fine. I also use standard headers instead of the one Dr. Stroustrup provides in his book for the first 10 chapters.

Originally this repository was intended to be a repository of exercises from the book, but it grew as I sought out clarification from outside sources or wanted to expand on a concept.

I intend on reorganizing this repository to make it less specific to the book and may add a wiki to provide basic tutorials.
